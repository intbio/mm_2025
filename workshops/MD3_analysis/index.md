# Workshop: Analyzing MD simulations in Gromacs

## Description
- We will outline basic approaches to analyze MD simulations trajectories.
- Duration: 90 minutes
- Objectives: be able to 
    - **5 seminar**
    - Open and analyze trajectories using MDAnalysis
    - Properly analyze equillibration, autocorellation and uncertainty.
    - Analyze protein RMSD
    - Analyze distances, angles, contacts, hydrogen bonds, etc.
    - Analyze radial distribution functions.
    - Analyze kinetic parameters (diffusion, etc.)
    - Analyze thermodynamic fluctuations
    


## Jupyter notebook
- [MD_analysis.ipynb](MD_analysis.ipynb)

## Required software and resources
- Access to a Jupyter notebook evironment with Python 3, MDAnalysis, nglview libraries
- Access to Newton cluster with Gromacs installed or install Gromacs at your local workstation. See [http://www.gromacs.org](http://www.gromacs.org)

## Learning resources
- [MD Analysis tutorials](https://www.mdanalysis.org/MDAnalysisTutorial/) 



## Assignments

From previous assignments you should have a simulation for a protein of your choice set up in Gromacs. You may need to adjust the simulation parameters if needed (trajectory write parameters, duration, temperature etc).
Following analyses of this system will be needed as an assignment:

**Seminar 5**
1. Calculate system density, perform proper etimate of statistical uncertainty.
2. Calcuate RMSD of the protein with time. Make conclusions if the system has reached local equilibrium state.
3. Calcuate distance between N- and C-ends of protein. Make conclusions if the system has reached local equilibrium state. 
4. Calcualte the number of hydrogen bonds within your protein and with water. Estimate average number (with uncertainty). Plot variation with time.
5. Calculate radial distribution function between water molecules.
6. Using VMD select water molecules within 3 Ã… of the protein. Visualize them as spheres and color white. Calculate their RMSD (min, max and average).



### Troubleshooting
- Consult with the seminar protocol/recording
- Ask questions in Slack
